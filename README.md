This repository contains a custom React hook `useDebounce` for debouncing input values. It includes an example of how to use the hook to debounce search input and fetch data from the Wikipedia API.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivangdatta/optimization-debouncing.git

## Brief Discription 
Debouncing is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is executed. In web development, it's often applied to functions that handle user input, like search or resize events. By debouncing input handlers, we ensure they are only invoked after a specified delay of inactivity, improving performance by reducing the number of executions and enhancing user experience by preventing excessive event triggers.

Effects of Debouncing
Debouncing helps:

Reduce Function Execution: Prevents functions from being called multiple times in quick succession, especially useful for functions tied to frequent events like scroll or keystrokes.

Optimize Performance: Limits resource-intensive operations, improving overall application responsiveness and efficiency.

Control Event Handling: Ensures actions are triggered only after the user has finished interacting with the interface, enhancing usability and preventing unintended actions.

By using debouncing, developers can manage how often certain actions occur in response to user input, balancing responsiveness with performance optimization.
